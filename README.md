# sign-up-form

As part of TheOdinProject intermediate HTML and CSS course, I was tasked with creating a sign-up form to test my knowledge of form elements.
This project is a basic page made with HTML and CSS only. 

This was a simple project, the main problems I had were dealing with layouts and sizing but I have a better understanding of form elements and even CSS pseudo-classes.
